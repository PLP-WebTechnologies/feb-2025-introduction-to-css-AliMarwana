    <p>Patience is an excellent virtue for any muslim who aspires to salvation.
         Surah Az-Zumar (39:10), Allah says: “Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without measure.” This is a joyous promise from Allah to those who choose to be patient in facing life's challenges.
         This immeasurable reward will be granted in the hereafter.
